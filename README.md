Simple Bootstrap / Angular Web Site Template
===
I created this simple template to build rapid prototypes and proof of concepts for clients.

It has a few overriding principles.

The site is built as a Single-Page Application (SPA)
---
Single-page applications are web applications in which the page is not reloaded at any time.

The controller and model are maintained in the client browser.

The required resources can either be downloaded entirely at the beginning or as needed.

The site is built using existing frameworks
---
Bootstrap provides modern web page layout and controls and is easily customizable.

Angular and AngularUI Router provides the controller and model functionality for easy data binding, deep-linking, and nested views.
